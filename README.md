# Personal Website - Milestone 1

## Overview

This is the first milestone project for the RevoU Front-End Web Development program. In this project, I created a personal website using HTML to build its structure.

## Implemented Features

- Semantic HTML structure (`<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`)
- Internal navigation using anchor links
- Website contains four main sections:
  - Home
  - About Me
  - Projects
  - Contact
- Contact form with basic validation (`required`)
- Clean and readable HTML code

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 (pure HTML, without CSS at this stage)
- GitHub Pages (for deployment)
- Git (for version control)

## Live Preview
